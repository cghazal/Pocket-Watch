# PocketWatch: your life, streamlined.

Getting tired of multi-tasking your apps? We were too. Discover a way to effortlessly combine all of your appointments that you've made through all of your apps without scrolling through a swamp of text messages and emails for hours. 

## Your day laid out on one page
PocketWatch automatically creates a schedule for you every day presented in a clear layout. The appointments that it picks are based on 
apps that you choose for it to sift through, such as Messages, Email, and Notes. Select the contacts who you keep up with everyday to 
include on the display, as well as any keywords that will help notify you of different appointments.

## We strip down your schedule so that you can exapnd it
Add notes and to-do lists to the outline that PocketWatch has already drawn for you; add customized timers and specify contacts to call or text for different events.

## Broaden your arsenal
We offer different subscriptions for additional tools on the app. Create folders for notes in business meetings, take pictures of doodles, and add more data to your app.
